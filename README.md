# STAT 423 Final Project

## Original proposal
##### Title: Which Anime should a company invest?Nowadays, the global content market has increasingly demand in Japanese Animation, known as Amine. The US has become the country with the highest demand for Anime other than Japan. Therefore, more companies are considering making investment in Anime. To have the advertisement exposed to more people, the companies prefer to invest those who are have higher rating or have more audiences. Thus, problems such as which genre is more popular, or when should the Anime be posted in order to attract more people are extremely important.



## Thoughts
response variable:(could be) score/favorite/follower/proportion between favorite and members ect.  
1. genre vs response  
2. change of flavor vs year  
3. within a certain type  
4. rating（分级）
